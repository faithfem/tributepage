<p> I can give you the Wikipedia link to The Pearl, but I also want to tell you what this book said to me when I read it at age 12 at the local college library. I haven't re-read it since, and
  don't really intend to, as the older I get, the less I can tolerate hard truths. But the wide-eyed innocence of pre-teenhood happened to be the best time to absorb the moral of this story, and
  probably forever, put me on the cautious side of life.

<p> As I grew up, I learnt that it is good to pursue things. It is good to have a passion for whatever you want, or whoever you want and passion does not usually include caution. But, the take
  from here is best summarized by a quote from the world of finance: "Watch the downside, the upside will take care of itself."
